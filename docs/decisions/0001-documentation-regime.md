# 0001: Documentation regime

**Status:** accepted

## Context

This project is written largely by AI agent sessions. Left alone, such sessions append to
whatever document looks plausible, restate signatures that rot on the first refactor, and leave
status files that duplicate git. The owner's PGMEmu, which took the regime from NGA, solved this.

## Decision

PGMEmu's regime is adopted whole, as written in
`../PGMWorkspace/PGMEmu/docs/decisions/0001-documentation-regime.md` and its `docs/README.md`:

- Every document answers exactly one question and has an explicit prohibition. The buckets are
  listed in [docs/README.md](../README.md), and a document must be indexed there before it may
  exist.
- Documentation carries *why* and *contracts*; code carries *how*.
- One fact, one place.
- No status files.
- Documentation changes in the same commit as the code that invalidated it.

`docs/hardware/` holds what no reference outside this repository holds: the expansion board's
specification, which exists nowhere else in its current form, and where the emulator knowingly
departs from its references ([0002](0002-references.md)).

## Consequences

- A milestone plan is a queue in `docs/plans/` that only shrinks; it never says what is done.
- Facts about the PET are not copied from VICE or TangPet into this repository's documents;
  documents link to them.
